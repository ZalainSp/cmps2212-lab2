# JavaScript DOM Labs - Zalain Spain

This project contains three practice exercises for learning how to use JavaScript with HTML.

## Project Files

**1. DOM Selection Practice (dom-practice.html)**
This file shows how to find specific elements on a web page using JavaScript. It includes code that checks if an element exists before trying to use it, which prevents errors.

**2. Color Changer (color-changer.html)**
This is a simple tool that changes the background color of boxes.
- Click "Make Red" to turn boxes red.
- Click "Make Blue" to turn boxes blue.
- Click "Reset" to change them back to gray.

**3. Text Highlighter (text-highlighter.html)**
This file demonstrates how to change the style of text dynamically.
- "Highlight All" adds a yellow background to all paragraphs.
- "Clear Highlights" removes the yellow background.
- "Toggle First" turns the highlight on and off for just the first paragraph.

## Concepts Learned
- Selecting single elements vs. lists of elements.
- Using loops to change multiple items at once.
- Adding and removing CSS classes using JavaScript.
- Handling button clicks with Event Listeners.
